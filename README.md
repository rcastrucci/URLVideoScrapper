# URL Video Scrapper

## Important Notice
This is a project **not to steal videos** around the internet! It is only intended to download
videos that you have the right to watch! I made this App because I bought a course and 
I didn't have enough time to watch it! And sometimes I just wanted to watch while I had
no internet available and I couldn't. So that's the main reason to use this App! 
And I don't encourage anyone to use this tool in another way if not legal.

## The idea 
Most of the websites try to secure their videos using Vimeo and other stream providers
to protect their users from downloading it. And I think this is not really fair with those
who bought the rights to watch and want to watch later and offline! If this is your case, here is a solution for that!

## How to do it!
## **MacOS**
For MacOS I manage to bundled the app so you don't need to deal with coding.<br><br>

## **Linux**
For Linux as well here is a bundled app to download<br><br>

## **Windows**
For **Windows** you need to have Java 17 or later installed in your computer and you will be able to run the Runnable Jar.<br>
[Download Runnable Jar file](https://github.com/rcastrucci/URLVideoScrapper/tree/main/Runnable%20Jar)

## Java?
To know if you have or not java installed just open a terminal window and type

    java --version

If you don't have Java installed you can download Java 17 directly from Oracle in this link - > [Download Java17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

## Steps
The first thing you will need to do is to log in to your course or website where is holding
the videos you want to download. If you are using Chrome, once you have opened the page
where the videos are in, just click on File and click Save Page As. Select the format 
"webpage complete". This will download the entire html and its childrens into a folder.
So basically that's all the work you have to do!
<br><br>
Now just open the URL Video Scrapper, click on the button "source" and select the downloaded folder 
Then click on the button "destination" and select the path where you want to save the videos. 
Then push "start"
<br><br>
Your videos will be downloaded on width 1280. If you want a different size you can edit the
file config.properties and uncomment which size fits you better.
